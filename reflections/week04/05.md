# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I learned this week that I need to pace myself with programming. I took very few breaks while I was working this week, and it did not treat me very well. I am very comfortable with APIs now, and I am confident in my ability to successfully complete the course. I had a lot of fun with the checkpoint this week. I reached most of the stretch goals and strengthened my understanding of javascript.
