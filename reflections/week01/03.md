2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page - a simple, yet appealing design

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A lot can be done with design. A major component of design is probably raising marketing efficiency for the products/services that certain webpages are advertising.
