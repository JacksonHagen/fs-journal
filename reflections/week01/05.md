# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week has been amazing. The content is extremely fast paced and pretty challenging, but I am thoroughly enjoying working through it. I was surprise at how fast the course is moving, especially for the first week. I would count the completion of my first checkpoint a major victory.
