## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

We use unit testing, component testing, and E2E testing. Unit testing is for each piece of a file.  Component testing is for testing how vue components function. End to end testing is testing all layers of the application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Unit testing. If all of the small pieces work properly, the end result is much more likely to work.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing. I see it as an extra step between unit testing and E2E testing.
