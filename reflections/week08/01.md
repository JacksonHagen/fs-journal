## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It serves as a means to show off skills that a developer has. They should pick 3-4 skills and focus on displaying them via projects within the portfolio

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Projects that clearly demonstrate that you have certain skills are very important. Having clear problem statements for each project is key to presentation.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would include Tower because it demonstrates my experience with several frameworks. It shows that I can use Vue, Node.js, and Bootstrap proficiently. It also looks quite presentable, which is always a bonus
