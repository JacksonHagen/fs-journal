## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is sort of like an instruction manual. There are definitions for all of the pre built classes and there are examples of syntax.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Docs can help when you want to do something but dont know how. They help me to put metaphorical pen to paper when programming

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Well written code docs can make or break a language. If there is a language that works amazingly, but nobody can read about to learn it, it will fail.
