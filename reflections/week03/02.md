## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

To control what the user has access to and to improve organization

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

I am unsure of what the problems are

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

In order to make a variable private, it has to be outside of an export in a file. We would do this to remove user access to changing those variables.
