## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are a value type of strictly typed data. They can be used to make sure a piece of data matches one element in a set of elements.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

To modify an enum, you can set the value of an enum member. You can also modify the base type.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used enums yet. I could've used it for categories on AllSpice for recipes.
