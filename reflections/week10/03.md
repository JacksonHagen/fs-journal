## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Columns have the key and define what type the data in the row is. The data in the row is the actual data.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
```sql
CREATE NEW TABLE characters(
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	age INT NOT NULL,
	description TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; --this one enables you to be able to target one element in a table
DROP TABLE table_name; --this one deletes the whole table
```
