## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys are the unique id that identifies a row on its table. A foreign key is used to reference data on another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

And alias is used when joining two tables. If both tables have a column named the same thing, you would alias the foreign column name to be something different

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
```
```sql
SELECT
	p.*,
	d.*,
	dp.id AS doctorsPatientId
FROM doctorsPatients dp
JOIN doctors d ON dp.doctorId = d.id
JOIN patients p ON dp.patientId = p.id
WHERE dp.doctorId = @DoctorId
```
