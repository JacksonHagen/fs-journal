## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has been a game changer. The concept of making a career out of programming went from a seemingly unattainable dream, to becoming a very possible reality for me. I have learned a lot about not only how to program, but about how to work on a team, expanding my professional network, and the importance of team comradery. My favorite part about this course has to be the extremely faced paced learning environment. College didn't work out for me because everything was so slow and mundane. Calculus was the starting level math in order to be allowed into the the CS program, which was also absurdly slow paced and mundane in my eyes. I can't learn if the program can't keep up with me. Another aspect of this field that I am still struggling with is time management. I really struggle allowing myself to take breaks, but I can see myself burn out if I don't. Because of mental health issues that I have struggled with and worked through immensely in the last 6 or so years, I also have a really hard time dealing with imposter syndrome. For a long time, I haven't seen myself as good enough in any aspect of my life. It never mattered how well I was doing at something, because to me, it wasn't good enough. I remember starting week 3 MVC. I was really struggling to wrap my head around encapsulation, and I started freaking out in the lecture. Things like "wow you're not even able to understand this? Why are you even here?" were incessantly running through my head. I'm not sure I was able to focus much on the actual content of that lecture at all. The next morning, I went into Harrison's office and told him that I didn't think I could do it. He gave me a piece of advice that I've held onto throughout the last 8 weeks. He told me, "If you compare yourself to others, you will always find reasons that your work isn't good enough." He said, "Compare yourself to you from a week ago. That's the only comparison that matters." And that really helped me get through the imposter syndrome throughout this course. Wow this is really long I apologize to whoever has to read this haha I'll be done now.
