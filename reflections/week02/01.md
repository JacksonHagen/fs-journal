## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where the variable is relevant

2. What is Hoisting ?

A mechanism within JavaScript that moves all variable and function declarations to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I would use let for local variables, var for global variables, and const for variables that cannot change (is it really a variable then?)
