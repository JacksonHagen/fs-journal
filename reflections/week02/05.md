# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I learned a lot about how to use javascript to accomplish tasks and build logic into webpages. I was surprised by how easy it is to write things such as for loops with emmet abbreviations. I am struggling with biting off more than I can chew and successfully accomplishing my goals. I would count the ice cream parlor as a fun victory this week.
