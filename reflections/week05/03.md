## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Planning out how long an event will take, and strictly adhering to the section of time.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Prioritize, Adapt, and Strategic Quitting. I will implement these with tools like trello boards and timers.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I benefit from timeboxing when working on checkpoints. This is because if I just choose to work until I'm done, I burn out after a while.
