## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is the text representation of an image. It is encoded binary data.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

The download size increases, cpu usage increases, load times increase because of caching, and ux gets worse. There are many drawbacks and not many positives.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

There are just more efficient ways to store data than Base64 now. Base64 is an old method of encoding that is no longer relevant anymore because of this.
